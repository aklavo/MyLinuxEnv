# MyLinuxEnv
Starting from a fresh install of Ubuntu these are the necessary steps and commands to setup my development enviorment. 

### 1. Basic Installs
Everything is a file! Anytime I install something I'm merely copying files from a remote location onto my local machine via a command in my terminal. The first two software packages I'll need are `git` and `curl`. These packages include commands necessary for me to install additional packages later. The `-y` option automatically answer `yes`  upon the *Do you want to continue [y/N]?* confirmation dialog.
To install these packages run:  
```
sudo apt install -y git curl
```
To confirm the installation and see where the executable file is located run:
```
which git curl
```
To nuke everything you just did (ie. uninstall or remove all packages and configuration files) run:
```
sudo apt-get autopurge git curl
```

### 2. Install Brave Browser
Next we need a better browser than Firefox, I choose Brave. We are gonna put in the apt sources so we can get updates easily but mostly just to look cool. Run the following commands assuming step 1 is complete. 
```
sudo curl -fsSLo /usr/share/keyrings/brave-browser-archive-keyring.gpg https://brave-browser-apt-release.s3.brave.com/brave-browser-archive-keyring.gpg

echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/brave-browser-archive-keyring.gpg] https://brave-browser-apt-release.s3.brave.com/ stable main"|sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/brave-browser-release.list

sudo apt update

sudo apt -y install brave-browser
```
### 3. Get ZSH
Next lets install zsh or zshell, because it lets us install cool plugins and themes. 
```
sudo apt -y install zsh
```
Next we need to swith our shell from bash to our newly installed zsh by running the change shell command with `-s` and the name of our shell. 
```
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```
To see the shell change you need to log out and log back in. 

### 4. Make ZSH Pretty
We're in a zsh shell now, but it's ugly. This first step to make it pretty is install `oh-my-zsh`, which is a framework for managing your Zsh configuration.
```
sh -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh -O -)"
```
Now lets get the cool fonts:
```
wget https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k-media/raw/master/MesloLGS%20NF%20Regular.ttf
wget https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k-media/raw/master/MesloLGS%20NF%20Bold.ttf
wget https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k-media/raw/master/MesloLGS%20NF%20Italic.ttf
wget https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k-media/raw/master/MesloLGS%20NF%20Bold%20Italic.ttf

mkdir -p $HOME/.local/share/fonts
mv Meslo* $HOME/.local/share/fonts
```
Open *Terminal* â†’ *Preferences* and click on the selected profile under *Profiles*. Check Custom font under *Text Appearance* and select `MesloLGS NF Regular`.  
Now for the cool stuff, powerlevel10k (a theme for zsh):
```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ~/powerlevel10k
echo 'source ~/powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k.zsh-theme' >>~/.zshrc
```


### 5. Install 1Password
Add the key for th 1Password apt repository:
```
curl -sS https://downloads.1password.com/linux/keys/1password.asc | sudo gpg --dearmor --output /usr/share/keyrings/1password-archive-keyring.gpg
```
Add the 1Password apt repository:
```
echo 'deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/1password-archive-keyring.gpg] https://downloads.1password.com/linux/debian/amd64 stable main' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/1password.list
```
Add the debsig-verify policy:
```
sudo mkdir -p /etc/debsig/policies/AC2D62742012EA22/
curl -sS https://downloads.1password.com/linux/debian/debsig/1password.pol | sudo tee /etc/debsig/policies/AC2D62742012EA22/1password.pol
sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/debsig/keyrings/AC2D62742012EA22
curl -sS https://downloads.1password.com/linux/keys/1password.asc | sudo gpg --dearmor --output /usr/share/debsig/keyrings/AC2D62742012EA22/debsig.gpg
